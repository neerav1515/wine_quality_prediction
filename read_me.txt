This is a mini multiple regression task of predicting wine qualities
Various python libraries are used for for computing and completing the task

Varoius tasks in general multiple regression include:

1)Deleting or filling non valid data values.
2)Splitting dependent and independent variables.
3)split data into train and test classes. 
4)feature scaling(used standardization).
5)train model with training data .
6)predict results with test data .
7)check r2 or absr2 value to check performance.
8)if performance is not good perform feature scaling(used p values in my model).
